# The Quest to Find the Legendary Pringles
This was my ISO 2O1 final project and was made from December 5, 2018- December 19, 2018. This game is a visual novel with concepts taught from ICS 201 where the player has to embark on a quest to find some "Legendary Pringles." This game utilizes the python graphics, winsound, and random library and other basic concepts taught throughout the course.
