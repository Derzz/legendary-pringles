# The Quest to Find The Legendary Pringles Walkthrough

## Note from the Developer

Hi there! Thanks for taking the time for reading this. This was my ICS 2O1 project where we had to create an interactive story using the python graphics library and there were a ton of other requirements that I can't recall at the moment. This project was on a strict two week deadline and even though the timing was tough, it was a pretty fun project to work on and learning how to make an interactive story and go through the development cycle. I have no idea how I thought of this idea, but even looking back on this four years later, it still was nice to see this game and was still pretty funny. For example, if you look at the question the guard is looking at, doesn't it seem pretty familiar to the start and end dates of this project? Nonetheless, this game may also contain bugs that I missed, but unless it's game breaking, just play around them. Welp, I hope you enjoy this game nonetheless, just as how much fun I had making this game four years ago! -Michael (・ω<)



## How to Get Pringbills

There are three pringbills hidden across the game(or page 1 to be specific). Below are their locations(Note, all pringbills are on page 1):

- Bookshelf
- Paper
- Trash Can

You would know if you got a pringbill if it made a "kaching noise" and the page 1 music restarts.



## All Endings List

### Legend Ending(Get Artifact)

- On page 5 when moving to the cave, go to the left of the screen. There you will see the pringles artifact and upon acquiring it and finishing the game, you will get the legend ending. This ending is non-dependent on the number of pringbills you get.

### Mega Ending(Get 3 Pringbills)

- If you acquire three pringbills without getting the artifact, you will get the mega ending.

### Jumbo Ending(Get 2 Pringbills)

- If you acquire two pringbills without getting the artifact, you will get the jumbo ending.

### Large Ending(Get 1 Pringbill)

- If you acquire one pringbill without getting the artifact, you will get the large ending.

### Sugar Ending(No Pringbills, Select Sugar as Weapon)

- If you have no pringbills without getting the artifact and selecting sugar as your weapon on page 2, you will get the sugar ending.

### Salt Ending(No Pringbills, Select Salt as Weapon)

- If you have no pringbills without getting the artifact and selecting salt as your weapon on page 2, you will get the salt ending.
